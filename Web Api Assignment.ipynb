The web API can be developed by using different technologies such as java, ASP.NET, etc. Web API is used in either a web server or a web browser. Basically Web API is a web development concept. It is limited to Web Application’s client-side and also it does not include a web server or web browser details. If an application is to be used on a distributed system and to provide services on different devices like laptops, mobiles, etc then web API services are used. Web API is the enhanced form of the web application."

    "1) Web service is a collection of open source protocols and standards used for exchanging data between systems or applications, whereas API is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user involvement.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, when a developer calls Instagram API to fetch a specific user (the resource), the API will return the state of that user, including their name, the number of posts that user posted on Instagram so far, how many followers they have, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The representation of the state can be in a JSON format, and probably for most APIs this is indeed the case. It can also be in XML or HTML format.\n",

    "The operation you want the server to perform on that resource, in the form of an HTTP method, or verb. The common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n",

    "SOAP is an XML-formatted, highly standardized web communication protocol. Released by Microsoft a year after XML-RPC, SOAP inherited a lot from it. When REST followed, they were first used in parallel, but soon REST won the popularity contest.\n",
    "\n",
    "How SOAP works\n",
    "XML data format drags behind a lot of formality. Paired with the massive message structure, it makes SOAP the most verbose API style.\n",

    "a header if a message must determine any specifics or extra requirements, and\n",
    "a fault informing of any errors that can occur throughout the request processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SOAP API logic is written in Web Service Description Language (WSDL). This API description language defines the endpoints and describes all processes that can be performed. This allows different programming languages and IDEs to quickly set up communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP supports both stateful and stateless messaging. In a stateful scenario, the server stores the received information that can be really heavy. But it’s justified for operations involving multiple parties and complex transactions."
